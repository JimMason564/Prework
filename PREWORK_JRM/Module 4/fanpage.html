    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
        Third Day was a Christian rock band formed in Marietta, Georgia 
        during the 1990s. The band was founded by lead singer Mac Powell, 
        guitarist Mark Lee (both of whom were the only constant members) 
        and Billy Wilkins. The band's name is a reference to the biblical 
        accounts of the resurrection of Jesus on the third day following 
        his crucifixion. The band was inducted in the Georgia Music Hall 
        of Fame on September 19, 2009. They have sold over 7 million albums
        in the United States and had 28 number one Christian album chart 
        radio hits. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Day">More from Wikipedia page</a>
